This allowed us to focus on the performance of the parts, using the 'XY' analysis for stress and strain analysis. Then we looked at the system as a whole, using the 'XY' tool to simulate the engine's characteristics such as torque, speed and efficiency. Finally, we assembled a prototype and tested it. This allowed us to validate the data from the simulations and thus the whole concept.",
